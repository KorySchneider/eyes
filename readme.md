Biases are taught; machines learn them.

More and more power, influence and credibility is being given to machines, and they are being used in a growing number of applications. What they see influences what they say. As we give machines the gift of sight we must pay attention to how they see, how they are being taught, how much power they have, and over whom they have power.

This piece is a meditation on seeing by humans, by machines, of humans, of machines.
